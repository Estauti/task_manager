# Task manager

This task manager is a tool that allows people to manage their tasks lol.

This project is for learning and practicing purposes. It's real simple, does not have authentication (yet) and the UI is pretty basic. But still, I could learn a bit about rails views, which is cool.

You can check the demo [here](https://estauti-task-manager.herokuapp.com/).
